# Springline Travels Application

This repository contains the Springline Travels application, which is an Infosys Springboard project developed as part of building a software architecture using the 4+1 architectural view model.

## Project Overview

Springline Travels is a travel management system designed to facilitate online bookings, reservations, and itinerary management for travelers. The application aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for customers while offering comprehensive travel services.

## Architecture

The Springline Travels application follows the 4+1 architectural view model, which provides a systematic approach to designing and documenting software architecture. The architectural views include:

1. **Logical View**: This view focuses on the high-level functionality and modules of the application. It defines the logical structure of the system, including the main components, their interactions, and dependencies.

2. **Development View**: This view provides insights into the organization of the development process. It outlines the development environment, tools, frameworks, and libraries used to build the application.

3. **Process View**: The process view emphasizes the runtime behavior of the system. It captures the dynamic aspects of the application, including the concurrency, communication protocols, and performance characteristics.

4. **Physical View**: The physical view describes the deployment and distribution of the system across various hardware resources. It outlines the physical infrastructure, hardware components, and network configuration.

5. **Scenarios**: Scenarios illustrate specific use cases or user stories to demonstrate how the system's architectural elements work together to provide the desired functionality.

## Files

This repository includes the following files:

- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, architecture, and files.

- `infosys.ppt`: Documents the logical view of the Springline Travels application.
